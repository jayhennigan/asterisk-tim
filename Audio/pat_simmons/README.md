While the precise origins of thes recordings is unclear, it's believed they originate from a prototype digital announcer produced by BT, which contained audio recorded directly from the original magnetic drum machine.

They came to me by way of the TIM2000 project: http://www.samhallas.co.uk/repository/tim_2000.htm
